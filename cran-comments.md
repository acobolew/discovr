## Package size

Installed size is 6.5Mb. This package contains learnr tutorials and associated data. I have minimized image/data files, but with 20 tutorials the total file sizes adds up, 
and because tutorials are self-contained there's duplication of (small) files across tutorials that is beyond my control. I can't see what else I can realistically do to make the package size smaller at this point in time 
so I request lenience.

## R CMD check results
