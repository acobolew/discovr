### `r cat_space(fill = blu)` Welcome to the `discovr` space pirate academy

Hi, welcome to **discovr** space pirate academy. Well done on embarking on this brave mission to planet `r rproj()`s, which is a bit like Mars, but a less red and more hostile environment. That's right, more hostile than a planet without water. Fear not though, the fact you are here means that you *can* master `r rproj()`, and before you know it you'll be as brilliant as our pirate leader Mae Jemstone (she's the badass with the gun). I am the space cat-det, and I will pop up to offer you tips along your journey.

On your way you will face many challenges, but follow Mae's system to keep yourself on track:

* `r bmu(height = 1.5)` This icon flags materials for *teleporters*. That's what we like to call the new cat-dets, you know, the ones who have just teleported into the academy. This material is the core knowledge that everyone arriving at space academy must learn and practice. For accessibility, these sections will also be labelled with [(1)]{.alt}.
* `r user_visor(height = 1.5)` Once you have been at space pirate academy for a while, you get your own funky visor. It has various modes. My favourite is the one that allows you to see everything as a large plate of tuna. More important, sections marked for cat-dets with visors goes beyond the core material but is still important and should be studied by all cat-dets. However, try not to be disheartened if you find it difficult. For accessibility, these sections will also be labelled with [(2)]{.alt}.
* `r user_astronaut(height = 1.5)` Those almost as brilliant as Mae (because no-one is quite as brilliant as her) get their own space suits so that they can go on space pirate adventures. They get to shout *RRRRRR* really loudly too. Actually, everyone here gets to should *RRRRRR* really loudly. Try it now. Go on. It feels good. Anyway, this material is the most advanced and you can consider it optional unless you are a postgraduate cat-det. For accessibility, these sections will also be labelled with [(3)]{.alt}.

It's not just me that's here to help though, you will meet other characters along the way:

* `r alien(height = 1.5)` aliens love dropping down onto the planet and probing humanoids. Unfortunately you'll find them probing you quite a lot with little coding challenges. Helps is at hand though. 
* `r robot(height = 1.5)` **bend-R** is our coding robot. She will help you to try out bits of `r rproj()` by writing the code for you before you encounter each coding challenge.
* `r bug(height = 1.5)` we also have our friendly alien bugs that will, erm, help you to avoid bugs in your code by highlighting common mistakes that even Mae Jemstone sometimes makes (but don't tell her I said that or my tuna supply will end). 

Also, use hints and solutions to guide you through the exercises (Figure 1).

</figure> 
 

By for now and good luck - you'll be amazing!

### Workflow

* Before attempting this tutorial it's a good idea to work through [this tutorial on how to install, set up and work within `r rproj()` and `r rstudio()`](https://milton-the-cat.rocks/learnr/r/r_getting_started/).

* The tutorials are self-contained (you practice code in code boxes). However, so you get practice at working in `r rstudio()` I strongly recommend that you create an Quarto document within an `r rstudio()` project and practice everything you do in the tutorial in the Quarto document, make notes on things that confused you or that you want to remember, and save it. Within this document you will need to load the relevant packages and data. 

![](https://youtu.be/mqT7c17tofE)

### Packages

This tutorial uses the following packages:

* `janitor` [@R-janitor]
* `here` [@R-here]

It also uses these packages from:

#### easystats 

- `effectsize` [@R-effectsize; @effectsize2020]
- `insight` [@R-insight]
- `parameters` [@R-parameters; @parameters2020]
 
#### tidyverse 
 
- `dplyr` [@R-dplyr]
- `forcats` [@R-forcats]
- `readr` [@R-readr]
- `tibble` [@R-tibble]
- `tidyr` [@R-tidyr].

### Coding style

There are (broadly) two styles of coding:

1. **Explicit**: Using this style you declare the package when using a function: `package::function()`. For example, if I want to use the `mutate()` function from the package `dplyr`, I will type `dplyr::mutate()`. If you adopt an explicit style, you don't need to load packages at the start of your Quarto document but code can get busy.

2. **Concise**: Using this style you load all of the packages at the start of your Quarto document using `library(package_name)`, and then refer to functions without their package. For example, if I want to use the `mutate()` function from the package `dplyr`, I will use `library(dplyr)` in my first code chunk and type the function as `mutate()` when I use it subsequently. The resulting code is less busy, but you can can stumble across clashes with functions.

Coding style is a personal choice, and neither approach is 'correct'. I recommend a hybrid which tries to have the best of both worlds, which is:

- Use concise style for `tidyverse` and `easystats` because by loading these in your first code chunk most functions you need will be loaded and so your code will be succinct.
- Use explicit style for packages that you'll use rarely.

You can use either style in this tutorial because all packages are pre-loaded. If working outside of the tutorial, load the `easystats` and `tidyverse` packages (and any others if you're using a concise style) at the beginning of your Quarto document:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(easystats)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Data

To work *outside of this tutorial* you need to download the following data file:

* [cat_dance.csv](https://www.discovr.rocks/csv/cat_dance.csv)

Set up an `r rstudio()` project in the way that [I recommend in this tutorial](https://milton-the-cat.rocks/learnr/r/r_getting_started/#section-working-in-rstudio), and save the data files to the folder within your project called [data]{.alt}. Place this code in the first code chunk in your Quarto document:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
dance_tib <- here::here("data/cat_dance.csv") |> readr::read_csv()
```

### Preparing data

To work *outside of this tutorial* you need to turn categorical variables into factors and set an appropriate baseline category using `forcats::as_factor` and `forcats::fct_relevel`. There are two categorical variables here: **training** (the animal was trained using either food or affection, not both) and **dance** (the animal either learnt to dance or it did not). For each variable, think about which category you'd want as your baseline or reference.  For **training** it doesn't matter too much, but for **dance** it makes sense to have 'No' as the reference category. Therefore, you might convert these variables to factors using this code:

```{r, eval= FALSE}
dance_tib <- dance_tib |> 
  dplyr::mutate(
    dance = as_factor(dance) |> fct_relevel("No"),
    training = forcats::as_factor(training) |> fct_relevel("Food")
  )
```

## `r bmu()` Dancing cats and entering data [(1)]{.alt}

A researcher was interested in whether animals could be trained to dance. He took 200 cats and tried to train them to dance by giving them either food or affection as a reward for dance-like behaviour. (Historically in this example the cats were taught to line dance. I was tempted to update the example to something more contemporary, like twerking cats, but I'm now haunted by intrusive images of lines of twerking cats slowly but purposefully following me around, which proves that sometimes it's best to leave well alone.) At the end of the week he counted how many animals could line-dance and how many could not. There are two categorical variables here: **training** (the animal was trained using either food or affection, not both) and **dance** (the animal either learnt to dance or it did not). By combining categories, we end up with four different categories. All we then need to do is to count how many cats fall into each category. Table 1 shows these frequencies.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
tibble::tribble(
  ~`Training`, ~`Danced`, ~`Did not dance`,
  "Food", 28, 10,
  "Affection", 48, 114
) |> 
  knitr::kable(caption = "Table 1: Frequencies of cats dancing after training using different rewards") |> 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = FALSE)
```

### `r bmu()` Entering raw scores [(1)]{.alt}

The first way is to enter each cat's data as a row of the data. You would create two variables (**training** and **dance**) and **training** might take on values of 'Food' and 'Affection', and dance would have values of 'Yes' and 'no'.

#### `r alien()` Alien coding challenge

These are what the data look like in `dance_tib`. Inspect this object using the code box.

```{r dance_data, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 2}

```

```{r dance_data-solution}
dance_tib
```

Note that there are 200 cats and, therefore, 200 rows of data. At this point you would convert **training** and **dance** to factors (as described in [preparing the data]{.alt}). Within this tutorial the variables are already converted to factors with the levels set such that 'No' is the baseline category for **dance**, and 'food' is the baseline category for **training**.


### `r bmu()` Entering data as frequencies [(1)]{.alt}

If you don't have the raw data but know the frequencies, you can enter the contingency table directly using the `tribble()` function from `tibble`. For example, we could create a tibble that has a variable **training** that specifies whether the food was reward or affection, then a variable **dance** that specifies whether the cat danced or not, and then a third variable **n** indicating how many cats fell into each combination of categories.

#### `r robot()` Code example

We can create this a tibble like this called `cat_freq` using the `tribble()` function from the `tibble` package (which is part of `tidyverse`). The code is:

```{r, eval= FALSE}
cat_freq <- tibble::tribble(
  ~training, ~dance, ~n,
  "Food", "No", 10,
  "Food", "Yes", 28,
  "Affection", "No", 114,
  "Affection", "Yes", 48,
)
```

The `tribble()` function lets you enter raw data in tabulated form, where each row represents a row of the data and columns are separated using commas. Notice the first row contains the variable names, so this sets up three columns, the first named **training** the second **dance** and so on. Each column name is preceded by a [~]{.alt}. After the first row, we input the raw data. For example row 2 tells `r rproj()` that the value of **training** is the word ["Food"]{.alt}, the corresponding value of **dance** is ["No"]{.alt} and the corresponding value of **n** is 10. Note that each row is ended with a comma except the last.

<div class="tip">
  `r cat_space()` **Tip**

If you want to use a column name with a space (not advised but hey, ho), then you need to include the name in backticks. In the previous example, if we wanted to use **did they dance** as the variable name instead of **dance** we can do so by using [\`did they dance\`]{.alt} as shown in the code below

```{r, eval = F, class.source = '.panel_alt'}
cat_freq <- tibble::tribble(
  ~training, ~`did they dance`, ~n,
  "Food", "No", 10,
  "Food", "Yes", 28,
  "Affection", "No", 114,
  "Affection", "Yes", 48,
)
```
</div>

#### `r alien()` Alien coding challenge

Create and inspect the object `cat_freq` using the code example in the previous section:

```{r cat_cont, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 7}

```

```{r cat_cont-solution}
cat_freq <- tibble::tribble(
  ~training, ~dance, ~n,
  "Food", "No", 10,
  "Food", "Yes", 28,
  "Affection", "No", 114,
  "Affection", "Yes", 48,
)
cat_freq
```

<div class="tip">
  `r cat_space()` **Tip**

You can use what we have learnt about data wrangling to convert the raw data into the frequency data. To transform the raw data into a table of frequency data we can use tidyverse:

```{r, eval = F, class.source = '.panel_alt'}
cat_freq <- dance_tib |> 
  group_by(training, dance) |> 
  tally() |> 
  ungroup()
```

This code pipes the raw data into `group_by()` where we ask it to perform any subsequent actions separately on all combinations of **dance** and **training**. The action we ask it to perform is to count the number of instances using `tally()`. By default, it places these counts in a new variable called **n**, but you can override this by placing [name = "name_i_prefer_to_n"]{.alt} within the function. We use `ungroup()` to remove the earlier grouping of the data. The resulting tibble will look the same as `cat_freq`.

</div>

#### `r alien()` Alien coding challenge

Try the code in the tip to convert the raw data to frequencies:

```{r cat_convert, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 7}

```

```{r cat_convert-solution}
cat_freq <- dance_tib |> 
  group_by(training, dance) |> 
  tally() |> 
  ungroup()
cat_freq
```



## `r bmu()` Exploring the data [(1)]{.alt}
### `r user_visor()` Creating contingency tables  [(2)]{.alt}

It can be helpful to display our frequencies in something know as a crosstabulation, which is where one variable (for example, **training**) makes up the rows and the other (**dance**) makes up the columns resulting in a 2 × 2 grid of frequencies. There are lots of ways to do this with R but we'll use the **janitor** package [@R-janitor], which creates [tabyl]{.alt} objects.

Let's use the `janitor::tabyl()` function to create a contingency table from the raw data (`dance_tib`). It has the general form:

```{r, eval = F}
tabyl(dat = my_tibble,
      var1 = "variable_for_rows",
      var2 = "variable_for_columns",
      var3 = "variable_for_tables") 
```

So, you put your data in (or pipe it in) and then if you specify two variable names it will use the first to construct rows of the contingency table, and the second to construct columns. In more complex situations you can also specify a third variable, and a 2 × 2 contingency table will be created for each category in this third variable.

#### `r robot()` Code example

For our raw data we could execute

```{r, aval = F}
cat_xtbl <- dance_tib |>
  janitor::tabyl(training, dance)
```


#### `r alien()` Alien coding challenge

Use the code example to create and view an object called [cat_xtbl]{.alt} containing the frequencies for the combinations of categories of **dance** and **training**.

```{r tally, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 6}

```

```{r tally-solution}
cat_xtbl <- dance_tib |>
  janitor::tabyl(training, dance)
# to view the object
cat_xtbl |> 
  display() 
```

We can see, for example, that 10 cats did not dance when rewarded with food. 

If working with frequency data, we take a different approach. The frequency data is in long format, whereas a contingency table typically spreads one variable across different columns. For example, we might choose to have the 'danced' or 'did not dance' data in separate columns. To achieve this we use the `pivot_wider()` function from `tidyr`, which we encountered in `discovr_06` and  `discovr_09`. To remind you, the `pivot_wider()` restructures rows into columns. It's general form is:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tidyr::pivot_wider(
  data = tibble,
  id_cols = variables_that_you_do_not_want_to_restructure,
  names_from = "variable_containing_the_names_of_columns",
  values_from = " variable_containing_the_scores",
)
```

If we want to spread values associated with 'yes' and 'no' on the variable **dance** across columns then we want to get the column [names_from]{.alt} the variable **dance**. The frequencies are stored in the variable **n**, so we'd want to get [values_from]{.alt} from that variable. Finally, we want to leave categories of **training** in rows so we'd select **training** as the [id_cols]{.alt} (in fact we can omit this argument because the function will assume that non-named variables should not be restructured). We'd also pipe the result through `as.data.frame()` (to remove some unhelpful attributes of tibbles) and `janitor::as_tabyl()` (to convert it to a [tabyl]{.alt}).

#### `r robot()` Code example

To create a contingency table called [cat_xtbl]{.alt} from the frequency data in [cat_freq]{.alt} we'd execute:

```{r eval = FALSE}
cat_xtbl <- cat_freq |>
  pivot_wider(
    values_from = "n",
    names_from = "dance"
  ) |>
  as.data.frame() |> 
  janitor::as_tabyl()
```

#### `r bug()` Alien coding challenge

Use the example code to create an object called [cat_xtbl]{.alt}, which is the contingency table for the number of cats that danced for different rewards.

```{r piv_wide, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 10}
             
```

```{r piv_wide-solution}
cat_xtbl <- cat_freq |>
  pivot_wider(
    values_from = "n",
    names_from = "dance"
  ) |>
  as.data.frame() |> 
  janitor::as_tabyl()
# This  displays the object we created above
cat_xtbl |>  
  display() 
```

### `r user_visor()` Tables of proportions [(2)]{.alt}

For interpretation purposes it can also be useful to convert the raw frequencies into proportions, but also to look at the proportions *within* each variable. Having created a [tabyl]{.alt} object (rather than a tibble) we can feed our contingency table into `janitor::adorn_percentages()`, which takes the general form

```{r, eval = F}
my_new_tbl <- janitor::adorn_percentages(dat = my_tabyl, denominator = "row")
```

in which [my_tabyl]{.alt} is the name of your contingency table, and [denominator]{.alt} determines whether proportions are computed within rows ([denominator = "row"]{.alt}), the default, within columns ([denominator = "col"]{.alt}), or overall ([denominator = "all"]{.alt}).

#### `r robot()` Code example

Let's first look at the overall proportions. To convert the frequencies in [cat_xtbl]{.alt} to overall proportions we could use this code.

```{r, eval = F}
prop_total <- cat_xtbl  |>
  janitor::adorn_percentages(denominator = "all")
```

#### `r bug()` Alien coding challenge

Use the code box to create and view a table of proportions called [prop_total]{.alt}.

```{r prop_total, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 6}
             
```

```{r prop_total-solution}
prop_total <- cat_xtbl  |>
  janitor::adorn_percentages(denominator = "all")
# display the table
prop_total |> 
  display()
```


The resulting table shows that `r get_xtab_prop(prop_total, 1, 1)` of all cats (`r get_xtab_prop(prop_total, 1, 1, percent = T)`) did not dance when given food, `r get_xtab_prop(prop_total, 2, 1)` of all cats (`r get_xtab_prop(prop_total, 2, 1, percent = T)`) did not dance when given affection, `r get_xtab_prop(prop_total, 1, 2)` of all cats (`r get_xtab_prop(prop_total, 1, 2, percent = T)`) danced when given food, and `r get_xtab_prop(prop_total, 2, 2)` of all cats (`r get_xtab_prop(prop_total, 2, 2, percent = T)`) danced when given affection.

It's also instructive to look at proportions *within* each variable. Let's first look at proportions within the variable **dance**. By looking at proportions within **dance** we ask the questions:

- Of the cats that danced, what proportion received food?
- Of the cats that did not dance, what proportion received food?

To get these proportions, we again use the `janitor::adorn_percentages()` but setting [denominator = "col"]{.alt} because the variable **dance** is spread across the columns of the contingency table.


#### `r bug()` Alien coding challenge

Use the code box to adapt the previous code to create a table of proportions [prop_dance]{.alt} where the proportions are computed within each level of **dance** separately. View the resulting table to 2 decimal places.

```{r prop_dance, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 6}
             
```

```{r prop_dance-solution}
prop_dance <- cat_xtbl  |>
  janitor::adorn_percentages(denominator = "col")
# display the table
prop_dance |> 
  display(digits = 2)
```

The resulting table shows that of the cats that did *not* dance `r get_xtab_prop(prop_dance, 1, 1)` (`r get_xtab_prop(prop_dance, 1, 1, percent = T)`) were trained with food and `r get_xtab_prop(prop_dance, 2, 1)` (`r get_xtab_prop(prop_dance, 2, 1, percent = T)`) with affection. In contrast, of the cats that *did* dance `r get_xtab_prop(prop_dance, 1, 2)` (`r get_xtab_prop(prop_dance, 1, 2, percent = T)`) were trained with food and `r get_xtab_prop(prop_dance, 2, 2)` (`r get_xtab_prop(prop_dance, 2, 2, percent = T)`) with affection.

Now let's look at proportions within the variable **training** to ask the questions

- Of the cats that received food, what proportion danced?
- Of the cats that received affection, what proportion danced?

To get these proportions, we again use the `janitor::adorn_percentages()` but setting [denominator = "row"]{.alt} because the variable **training** is spread across the rows of the contingency table.


#### `r bug()` Alien coding challenge

Use the code box to create a table of proportions [prop_training]{.alt} where the proportions are computed within each level of **training** separately. View the resulting table to 2 decimal places.

```{r prop_training, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 6}
             
```

```{r prop_training-solution}
prop_training <- cat_xtbl  |>
  janitor::adorn_percentages(denominator = "row")
# display the table
prop_training |> 
  display(digits = 2)
```

The resulting table shows that of the cats rewarded with food `r get_xtab_prop(prop_training, 1, 1)` (`r get_xtab_prop(prop_training, 1, 1, percent = T)`) did *not* dance and `r get_xtab_prop(prop_training, 1, 2)` (`r get_xtab_prop(prop_training, 1, 2, percent = T)`) did dance. This pattern was reversed for cats trained with affection, with `r get_xtab_prop(prop_training, 2, 1)` (`r get_xtab_prop(prop_training, 2, 1, percent = T)`) *not* dancing and `r get_xtab_prop(prop_training, 2, 2)` (`r get_xtab_prop(prop_training, 2, 2, percent = T)`) dancing. In short, using a food reward about 3/4 of cats danced and 1/4 didn't, whereas with affection the opposite was true with about 1/3 of cats dancing and 2/3 refusing.

## `r bmu()` The chi-square test [(1)]{.alt}
### `r bmu()` Running the test [(1)]{.alt}

There is a function `chisq.test()` in base `r rproj()` to obtain a chi-square test, but so we can use our contingency table, we will use `janitor::chisq.test()`. The functions work identically, but the later one allows us to input our tably object.

The function takes the general form

```{r, eval = F}
janitor::chisq.test(x = my_tabyl, correct = TRUE)
```

Basically, input your contingency table [cat_xtbl]{.alt} to the function and you're good to go. The other argument is:

- [correct]{.alt}: when [TRUE]{.alt} Yates' continuity correction is applied when the contingency table is 2 $\times$ 2 in size. There's no reason to change the default of applying this correction.
 

#### `r robot()` Code example

Given that the defaults are fine, we can apply the chi-square test to our contingency table [cat_xtbl]{.alt} using the following code:

```{r, eval = F}
cat_chi <- janitor::chisq.test(x = cat_xtbl)
model_parameters(cat_chi) |> 
  display()
```

This code creates an object called [cat_chi]{.alt} that stores information from the chi-square test. We are saving the test to an object because to fully interpret the test we need extract some of this information later. As with any other model, we use `model_parameters()` to extract the key information, and `display()` to display the results.

<div class="bug">
  `r bug()` **De-bug**

  Note, the `janitor::` part is important to make sure we're using the version of the text that works with [tably]{.alt} objects.

#### `r alien()` Alien coding challenge

Use the example code to get a chi-square test for **training** as a predictor of **dance**.

```{r crosstab_cont, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 6}

```

```{r crosstab_cont-solution}
# Fit the model
cat_chi <- janitor::chisq.test(x = cat_xtbl)
# Show the results
model_parameters(cat_chi) |> 
  display() 
```


<br />

<div class="infobox">
  `r info()` **Without Yates' correction**

If we set [correct = F]{.alt} to remove the continuity correction we get the following results

```{r}
cat_chi <- janitor::chisq.test(x = cat_xtbl, correct = FALSE)
model_parameters(cat_chi) |> 
  display()
```

You can see a small increase to the chi-square statistic (because it hasn't been corrected). There's also (trust me) a small decrease in the *p*-value (because the test statistic is larger) but it is still less than 0.001 so it doesn't change the output. Our conclusions are unchanged.

</div>


### `r bmu()` Interpreting the chi-square test [(1)]{.alt}

The value of the chi-square statistic is `r sprintf("%.2f", cat_chi$statistic)` and this value is highly significant because the associated *p* is is smaller than 0.05 (it is `r sprintf("%.8f", cat_chi$p.value)`).

<div class="reportbox">
  `r pencil()` **Report**`r rproj()`

There was a significant association between the type of reward used and whether cats danced, $\chi^2$(`r cat_chi$parameter`) = `r sprintf("%.2f", cat_chi$statistic)`, *p* < 0.001.
</div>

### `r user_visor()` Using cell proportions [(2)]{.alt}

We know that there is a significant association between the type of reward used and whether cats danced, but to understand what's driving that association we can look at the tables of proportions we obtained earlier. These proportions can be particularly useful for 2 × 2 contingency tables. For example, remember that the proportions of cats dancing within each training group was

```{r, echo = F}
prop_training |> 
  display()
```



which shows us that of the cats trained with food `r get_xtab_prop(prop_training, 1, 1)` (`r get_xtab_prop(prop_training, 1, 1, percent = T)`) did *not* dance and `r get_xtab_prop(prop_training, 1, 2)` (`r get_xtab_prop(prop_training, 1, 2, percent = T)`) did dance. This pattern was reversed for cats trained with affection, with `r get_xtab_prop(prop_training, 2, 1)` (`r get_xtab_prop(prop_training, 2, 1, percent = T)`) *not* dancing and `r get_xtab_prop(prop_training, 2, 2)` (`r get_xtab_prop(prop_training, 2, 2, percent = T)`) dancing. In short, using a food reward about 3/4 of cats danced and 1/4 didn't, whereas with affection the opposite was true with about 1/3 of cats dancing and 2/3 refusing.

> The overall association between rewards and dancing seems to reflect the fact that food rewards were more effective at getting cats to dance than affection.


### `r user_astronaut()` Using standardized residuals [(3)]{.alt}

Proportions are sometimes enough to make sense of a chi-square test, but it is not always as clear cut as this example. Also, for contingency tables larger than 2 × 2, proportions might not be as easy to interpret. Standardized residuals are another way to unpick a significant overall association between two variables. The standardized residual is a *z*-score: if the value lies outside of $\pm$ 1.96 then it is significant at *p* < 0.05, if it lies outside $\pm$ 2.58 then it is significant at *p* < 0.01, and if it lies outside $\pm$ 3.29 then it is significant at *p* < 0.001. These residuals are stored within the [cat_chi]{.alt} object that we created under the name **residuals**, so we can view them using the `insight::get_residuals()` function, which is part of [easystats]{.alt}, which we already have loaded.

```{r, eval = F}
get_residuals(cat_chi) |> 
  display()
```

#### `r alien()` Alien coding challenge

View the residuals from [cat_chi]{.alt}.

```{r chi_resid, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 4}

```

```{r chi_resid-solution}
get_residuals(cat_chi) |> 
  display()
```

There are four residuals: one for each combination of the type of reward and whether the cats danced. When food was used as a reward the standardized residual was significant for both those that danced (*z* = `r get_xtab_prop(cat_chi$residuals, 1, 2)`) and those that didn't dance (*z* = `r get_xtab_prop(cat_chi$residuals, 1, 1)`). The plus or minus sign tells us something about the direction of the effect. We can interpret these standardized residuals as follows: when food was used as a reward significantly more cats than expected danced, and significantly fewer cats than expected did not dance.

When affection was used as a reward the standardized residual was not significant both for those that danced (*z* = `r get_xtab_prop(cat_chi$residuals, 2, 2)`) and those that did not (*z* = `r get_xtab_prop(cat_chi$residuals, 2, 1)`). These residuals tell us that when affection was used a reward as many cats as expected danced and did not dance.

In a nutshell, the cells for when food was used as a reward both significantly contribute to the overall chi-square statistic: the association between the type of reward and dancing is mainly driven by when food is a reward.

## `r bmu()` Checking assumptions [(1)]{.alt}

Finally, let's check the expected frequencies. We have a 2 × 2 table, so all expected frequencies need to be greater than 5. The expected frequencies are stored in a variable called **expected** and we can access them using

```{r, eval = F}
cat_chi$expected
```


<div class="tip">
  `r cat_space()` **Tip**

Remember that to specify something within an object we use `$` to mean 'within', so the general format is

```{r, eval = F, class.source = '.panel_alt'}
object$item
```

meaning 'the item within the object'. For example, to access the variable **dance** within the tibble called [dance_tib]{.alt} we'd use

```{r, eval = F, class.source = '.panel_alt'}
dance_tib$dance
```

meaning 'the variable called **dance** within the tibble called [dance_tib]{.alt}'.

</div>



#### `r alien()` Alien coding challenge

View the expected frequencies from [cat_chi]{.alt}.

```{r expct, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 4}

```

```{r expct-solution}
cat_chi$expected |> 
  display()
```

The smallest expected count is `r sprintf("%.2f", min(cat_chi$expected[2:3]))` (for cats that were trained with food and did dance). This value exceeds 5 and so the assumption has been met.

<div class="infobox">
  `r info()` **When assumptions are broken**

When the expected frequencies of the contingency table are too small (i.e. the assumption of the chi-square test is broken), you should instead use Fisher's exact test, which is described later in this tutorial.
</div>


## `r user_visor()` The odds ratio [(2)]{.alt}

A common and useful measure of effect size for categorical data is the odds ratio. We can use the `oddsratio()` function from the `effectsize` package to obtain this measure. Essentially we enter our contingency table `cat_xtbl` into the function. 

#### `r robot()` Code example

Our contingency table looks like this: 

```{r}
cat_xtbl |> 
  display()
```

but `oddsratio()` wants only the numbers in that table, so we need to remove the first column (which, for our data, is called **training**). We can do this using `dplyr::select()`, which we have used many times before. 

```{r, eval = F}
cat_xtbl |> 
  select(-training) |> 
  oddsratio() |> 
  display()
```

This code takes our contingency table, subtracts (removes) the column called **training**, feeds it into `oddsratio()` to, erm, get the odds ratio and then displays the results.

#### `r alien()` Alien coding challenge

Obtain and view the odds ratio from [cat_chi]{.alt}.

```{r or, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 6}

```

```{r or-solution}
cat_xtbl |> 
  select(-training) |> 
  oddsratio() |> 
  display()
```

The output includes the odds ratio and its confidence interval. The observed odds ratio is `r sprintf("%.2f", cat_or$Odds_ratio)` and the limits of the 95% confidence interval are `r sprintf("%.2f", cat_or$CI_low)` and `r sprintf("%.2f", cat_or$CI_high)`. An odds ratio of 1 represents no effect, so the important thing is that this 95% confidence interval does not cross 1. A value of 1 would mean that the odds of dancing after affection would be exactly the same as dancing after food. The fact that the interval does not include 1 suggests, if we assume that our sample is one of the 95% of samples that generates a 95% confidence interval containing the population value, that the population odds ratio is also not 1. In other words, there is a non-zero effect of reward on dancing.

<div class="infobox">
  `r info()` **Odds ratios**

You can take the reciprocal of the odds ratio to reverse the direction of the effect. For example, we know that if a cat was trained with affection the odds of their dancing were `r sprintf("%.2f", cat_or$Odds_ratio)` times the odds if they had been trained with affection. Another way of stating this effect is that if a cat was trained with food the odds of their dancing were 1/`r sprintf("%.2f", cat_or$Odds_ratio)` = `r sprintf("%.2f", 1/cat_or$Odds_ratio)` times greater than the odds if they had been trained with affection.
</div>

<div class="reportbox">
  `r pencil()` **Report**`r rproj()`

There was a significant association between the type of reward used and whether cats danced, $\chi^2$(`r cat_chi$parameter`) = `r sprintf("%.2f", cat_chi$statistic)`, *p* < 0.001. If a cat was trained with affection the odds of their dancing were `r sprintf("%.2f", cat_or$Odds_ratio)` times the odds if they had been trained with affection, `r report_es(cat_or, col = "Odds_ratio")`

</div>


## `r user_visor()` Fisher's exact test [(2)]{.alt}

When the expected frequencies of the contingency table are too small (i.e. the assumption of the chi-square test that we explored earlier is broken), you should instead use Fisher's exact test. The `janitor::fisher.test()` function, which again is the same as the `fisher.test()` function from base ` rproj()`, but works on tably objects. This function is very similar to the `chisq.test()` function, but has a few more arguments. The general form including the more relevant arguments is

```{r, eval = F}
janitor::fisher.test(x = my_tably,
           alternative = "two.sided",
           or = 1,
           conf.int = TRUE,
           conf.level = 0.95,
           simulate.p.value = FALSE,
           B = 2000)
```

The default values are all fine but

* [alternative = "two.sided"]{.alt}: by default a two-sided test is performed of whether the observed odds ratio is different to the value set in the [or]{.alt} argument. By default the null odds ratio is set as 1 ([or = 1]{.alt}) so we get a test of whether the observed odds ratio is *different to* 1. If we specify [alternative = "greater"]{.alt} then we conduct a one-sided test of whether the observed odds ratio is *greater than* 1, and with [alternative = "less"]{.alt} then we conduct a one-sided test of whether the observed odds ratio is *less than* 1.
* [conf.int = TRUE]{.alt}: by default we will get a 95% confidence interval for the odds ratio, but set this to [conf.int = FALSE]{.alt} if, for some bizarre reason, you don't want one.
* [conf.level = 0.95]{.alt}: sets the level of the aforementioned confidence interval as a proportion. By default we get a 95% interval.
* [simulate.p.value = FALSE]{.alt}: Sometimes the test will fail, in which case you can try to obtain a *p*-value using simulation by setting [simulate.p.value = TRUE]{.alt}.
* [B = 2000]{.alt}: When obtaining a *p*-value using simulation this argument determines the number of replications used (by default 2000 but use this argument to change that default).

#### `r robot()` Code example

Using the contingency table we get 

```{r}
cat_fish <- cat_xtbl |> 
  janitor::fisher.test()
```


#### `r alien()` Alien coding challenge

Conduct and view Fisher's exact test.

```{r fet, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 6}

```

```{r fet-solution}
cat_fish <- cat_xtbl |> 
  janitor::fisher.test()
#to view the results
model_parameters(cat_fish) |> 
  display()
```

Although this is called a test, Fisher's exact test doesn't have a test statistic. Instead we get the odds ratio and its confidence interval (which tally to within rounding of what we have already calculated) and a *p*-value of the test that the odds ratio is different to 1 (by default). The fact that *p* < 0.001 tells us that the odds ratio of `r sprintf("%.2f", cat_fish$estimate)` is significantly different from 1. As mentioned before, an odds ratio of 1 represents no effect, so the test reveals that the observed odds ratio is significantly different from 'no effect'. 


<div class="reportbox">
  `r pencil()` **Report**`r rproj()`

Fisher's exact test showed that the odds ratio was significantly different from 1, $\widehat{\text{OR}}$ = `r sprintf("%.2f", cat_fish$estimate)`, [`r sprintf("%.2f", cat_fish$conf.int[1])`, `r sprintf("%.2f", cat_fish$conf.int[2])`], *p* < 0.001. If we assume that our sample is one of the 95% of samples that generates a 95% confidence interval containing the population value, that the population odds ratio is also not 1. In other words, there was a non-zero effect of reward on dancing.
