\title{discovr: Resources for Discovering Statistics Using R and RStudio (Field, 2021)}
\description{
The \code{discovr} package contains interactive \code{learnr} tutorials and datasets that accompany my 2021 textbook \href{https://www.discovr.rocks/}{Discovering Statistics Using R and RStudio}.
}
\section{Who is the package aimed at?}{


Anyone teaching from or reading \href{https://www.discovr.rocks/}{Discovering Statistics Using R and RStudio} should find these resources useful.
}

\section{Interactive tutorials}{


\strong{Getting started}:

I recommend working through \href{http://milton-the-cat.rocks/learnr/r/r_getting_started/}{this tutorial} on how to install, set up and work within R and RStudio before starting the interactive tutorials.

\strong{Running a tutorial}:

To run each tutorial execute\preformatted{learnr::run_tutorial("name_of_tutorial", package = "discovr")
}

Replacing \code{name_of_tutorial} with the name in bold below. For example, to load the tutorial \code{discovr_02} execute:\preformatted{learnr::run_tutorial("discovr_02", package = "discovr")
}
\itemize{
\item \strong{discovr_01}: Key concepts in R (functions and objects, packages and functions, style, data types, tidyverse, tibbles)
\item \strong{discovr_02}: Summarizing data (frequency distributions, grouped frequency distributions, relative frequencies, histograms, mean, median, variance, standard deviation, interquartile range)
\item \strong{discovr_03}: Confidence intervals: interactive app demonstrating what a confidence interval is, computing normal and bootstrap confidence intervals using R, adding confidence intervals to data summaries
\item \strong{discovr_05}: Visualizing data. The ggplot2 package, boxplots, plotting means, violin plots, scatterplots, grouping by colour, grouping using facets, adjusting scales, adjusting positions.
\item \strong{discovr_06}: The beast of bias. Restructuring data from messy to tidy format (and back). Spotting outliers using histograms and boxplots. Calculating z-scores (standardizing scores). Writing your own function. Using z-scores to detect outliers. Q-Q plots. Calculating skewness, kurtosis and the number of valid cases. Grouping summary statistics by multiple categorical/grouping variables.
\item \strong{discovr_07}: Associations. Plotting data with GGally. Pearson's r, Spearman's Rho, Kendall's tau, robust correlations.
\item \strong{discovr_08}: The general linear model (GLM). Visualizing the data, fitting GLMs with one and two predictors. Viewing model parameters with broom, model parameters, standard errors, confidence intervals, fit statistics, significance.
\item \strong{discovr_09}: Categorical predictors with two categories (comparing two means). Comparing two independent means, comparing two related means, effect sizes.
\item \strong{discovr_10}: Moderation and mediation. Centring variables (grand mean centring), specifying interaction terms, moderation analysis, simple slopes analysis, Johnson-Neyman intervals, mediation with one predictor, direct and indirect effects, mediation using lavaan.
\item \strong{discovr_11}: Comparing several means. Essentially 'One-way independent ANOVA' but taught using a general linear model framework. Covers setting contrasts (dummy coding, contrast coding, and linear and quadratic trends), the \emph{F}-statistic and Welch's robust \emph{F}, robust parameter estimation, heteroscedasticity-consistent tests of parameters, robust tests of means based on trimmed data, \emph{post hoc} tests, Bayes factors.
\item \strong{discovr_12}: Comparing means adjusted for other variables. Essentially 'Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA)' designs but taught using a general linear model framework. Covers setting contrasts, Type III sums of squares, the \emph{F}-statistic, robust parameter estimation, heteroscedasticity-consistent tests of parameters, robust tests of adjusted means, \emph{post hoc} tests, Bayes factors.
\item \strong{discovr_13}: Factorial designs. Fitting models for two-way factorial designs (independent measures) using both lm() and the afex package. This tutorial builds on previous ones to show how models can be fit with two categorical predictors to look at the interaction between them. We look at fitting the models, setting contrasts for the two categorical predictors, obtaining estimated marginal means, interaction plots, simple effects analysis, diagnostic plots, partial eta-squared and partial omega-squared, robust models and Bayes factors.
\item \strong{discovr_14}: Repeated measures designs. Fitting models for one- and two-way repeated measures designs using the afex package. This tutorial builds on previous ones to show how models can be fit with one or two categorical predictors when these variables ahve been manipulated within the same entities. We look at fitting the models, setting contrasts for the categorical predictors, obtaining estimated marginal means, interaction plots, simple effects analysis, diagnostic plots, robust models and Bayes factors.
\item \strong{discovr_15}: Mixed designs. Fitting models for mixed designs using the afex package. This tutorial builds on previous ones to show how models can be fit with one or two categorical predictors when at least one of these variables has been manipulated within the same entities and at least one other has been manipulated using different entities. We look at fitting the models, setting contrasts for the categorical predictors, obtaining estimated marginal means, interaction plots, simple effects analysis, diagnostic plots, robust models and Bayes factors.
}

\strong{Workflow}:
The tutorials are self-contained (you practice code in code boxes) so you don't need to use RStudio at the
same time. However, to get the most from them I would recommend that you create an RStudio project and within that open (and save) a new
R Markdown file each time to work through a tutorial. Within that Markdown file, replicate parts of the code from the tutorial (in code chunks)
and use Markdown to write notes about what you have done, and to reflect on things that you have struggled with, or note useful tips to help you
remember things. Basically, write a learning journal. This workflow has the advantage of not just teaching you the code that you need to do certain things,
but also provides practice in using RStudio itself.
