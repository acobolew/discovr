\details{
Hill et al.  (2007) examined whether providing children with a leaflet based on the \emph{theory of planned behaviour} increased their
exercise. There were four different interventions (intervention): a control group, a leaflet, a leaflet and quiz, and a leaflet and a plan.
A total of 503 children from 22 different classrooms were sampled (classroom). The 22 classrooms were randomly assigned to the four different conditions.
Children were asked \emph{On average over the last three weeks, I have exercised energetically for at least 30 minutes ___ times per week} after the intervention (post_exercise).
The data from the study has three variables:
\itemize{
\item \strong{intervention}: The intervention assigned to the classroom (control group, leaflet, leaflet and quiz, leaflet and plan).
\item \strong{classroom}: the classroom to which a child belonged
\item \strong{pre_exercise}: The exercise score pre-intervention (it's unclear to me from the paper how this was derived from the question asked!)
\item \strong{post_exercise}: The exercise score post-intervention (see above)
}
