\item \strong{id}: participant ID (not from the original data)
\item \strong{consumption}: pornography consumption on a scale from 0 (low) to 8 (high)
\item \strong{ln_porn}: log transformed values of consumption
\item \strong{commit}: commitment to the participant's current relationship on a scale from 1 (low) to 5 (high)
\item \strong{phys_inf}: whether the person had committed a physical act that they or their partner would consider to be unfaithful (0 = no, 1 = one of them would consider it unfaithful, 2 = both of them would consider it unfaithful)
\item \strong{hook_up}: the number of people they had 'hooked up' with in the previous year. (A 'hook-up' was defined to participants as 'when two people get together for a physical encounter and don't necessarily expect anything further')
