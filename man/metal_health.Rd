\details{
Lacourse et al. (2001) conducted a study to see whether suicide risk was related to listening to heavy metal music.
They devised a scale to measure preference for bands falling into the category of heavy metal.
This scale included heavy metal bands (Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden), speed metal bands (Slayer, Metallica),
death/black metal bands (Obituary, Burzum) and gothic bands (Marilyn Manson, Sisters of Mercy).
They then used this (and other variables) as predictors of suicide risk based on a scale measuring suicidal ideation etc.
These data are from a fictitious replication. There are two variables representing scores on the scales described above:
\itemize{
\item \strong{hm}: the extent to which the person listens to heavy metal music
\item \strong{suicide}: the extent to which someone has suicidal ideation
}
