\description{
A dataset from Field, A. P. (2022). Discovering statistics using R and RStudio (2nd ed.). London: Sage.

\details{
Data illustrating the difference between an outlier and an influencial case. The data came to me via David Hitchin, and he in turn got it from Dr Richard Roberts.
I have no idea whether it's real or fictitious. The tibble contains the following variables:
\itemize{
\item \strong{pubs}: The number of pubs in a particular district of London
\item \strong{mortality}: The mortality rate in that district
}
