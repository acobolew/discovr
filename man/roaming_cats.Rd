A dataset from Field, A. P. (2023). Discovering statistics using R and RStudio (2nd ed.). London: Sage.

\details{
Fictional data about roaming cats. I was interested in the relationship between the sex of a cat and how much time it spent away from home.
I had heard that male cats disappeared for substantial amounts of time on long-distance roams around the neighbourhood (something about hormones driving them to find mates) whereas female cats tended to be more homebound.
The data set has four variables
\itemize{
\item \strong{id}: Cat id
\item \strong{time}: Time spent away from home per week
\item \strong{sex}: biological sex of the cat as a factor
}
