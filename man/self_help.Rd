\details{
'Pop psychology' books sometimes spout nonsense that is unsubstantiated by science. I took 20 people in
relationships and randomly assigned them to one of two groups. One group read the famous popular psychology
book \emph{Women are from Bras and men are from Penis}, and the other read \emph{Marie Claire}. The outcome variable was
their relationship happiness after their assigned reading. The (fictional) data contains the following variables:
\itemize{
\item \strong{id}: the participant's id
\item \strong{book}: whether the participants read \emph{Women are from bras and men are from penis} or \emph{Marie Claire}
\item \strong{happy}: the participant's relationship happiness after reading the book assigned to them
