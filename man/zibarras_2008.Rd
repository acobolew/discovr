\details{
Zibarras, Port, and Woods (2008) looked at the relationship between personality and creativity.
They used the Hogan Development Survey (HDS), which measures 11 dysfunctional dispositions of employed adults:
being \emph{volatile}, \emph{mistrustful}, \emph{cautious}, \emph{detached}, \emph{passive_aggressive}, \emph{arrogant},
\emph{manipulative}, \emph{dramatic}, \emph{eccentric}, \emph{perfectionist}, and \emph{dependent}.
\itemize{
\item \strong{id}: The participant id
\item \strong{volatile}: responses to the question items of the HDS relating to the \emph{volatile} disposition.
\item \strong{mistrustful}: responses to the question items of the HDS relating to the \emph{mistrustful} disposition.
\item \strong{cautious}: responses to the question items of the HDS relating to the \emph{cautious} disposition.
\item \strong{detached}: responses to the question items of the HDS relating to the \emph{detached} disposition.
\item \strong{passive_aggressive}: responses to the question items of the HDS relating to the \emph{passive_aggressive} disposition.
\item \strong{arrogant}: responses to the question items of the HDS relating to the \emph{arrogant} disposition.
\item \strong{manipulative}: responses to the question items of the HDS relating to the \emph{manipulative} disposition.
\item \strong{dramatic}: responses to the question items of the HDS relating to the \emph{dramatic} disposition.
\item \strong{eccentric}: responses to the question items of the HDS relating to the \emph{eccentric} disposition.
\item \strong{perfectist}: responses (1-5) to the question \emph{I have said to myself 'just a few more minutes on the Internet.'}
